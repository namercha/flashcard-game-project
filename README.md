# flashcard-game-project

This project creates a flashcard app game to help the user study and learn vocabulary. 
The user can select by clicking the check that they know a card. This card will no longer need to be studied. This card will be removed from the rotation. 
When a user selects that a card does have to be studied, the card will be kept in rotation.
